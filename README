TO RUN THE TABLESTUCK BOT, YOU FIRST NEED TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS --

1- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

  When the Node.js installation asks if you want to install tools necessary to compile native modules, please make sure that the box is checked!
  If you don't do this, you will need to install python and Visual Studio c++ manually.

2- Create a folder for the bot
  Download this repository and put it in a folder inside that folder.
  ->Bot folder/
    ->This repository as a folder/
      ->bot.js, other folders and files...

3- Create a text file called auth.json and paste the following into it --
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE"
  }

  The bot has a TOURNAMENT MODE. If client.limit in bot.js is 0, it is disabled, but if it is a number greater than 0, it is enabled.
  If the bot is in TOURNAMENT MODE, auth.json will need an extra section called "list" with a list of discord IDs allowed in your tournament:
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE",
    "list": [
        "DISCORD ID",
        "DISCORD ID"
    ]
  }

4- Replace the information in the token and admin spaces with your own information to connect this program to your own discord bot

5- Create an empty folder called "data" in the same folder as auth.json

6- Open the command terminal on your computer in the bot's folder and type the following --
  npm install discord.js
  npm install enmap
  npm install canvas
  This should create a folder called node_modules/ and files called package.json and package-lock.json
  After that, the folder should be something like this --
  ->Bot folder/
    ->data/
    ->node_modules/
    ->This repository as a folder/
      ->bot.js, other folders and files...
    ->auth.json
    ->package.json
    ->package-lock.json

7- Run the file "run.bat" (or "run.sh" on linux or mac) to start the bot
  If you have nodemon or forever installed, you can use runrepeat.bat (runrepeat.sh) or runforever.bat (runforever.sh) to run the bot with those

--this code is not the finished version of the bot and will continue to be updated regularly on github--
